Our minimum spec for the PC is an Intel i5 CPU with 8Gb RAM, but we recommend an i7 and 16Gb. It needs a 3D graphics card, and we recommend NVIDIA hardware, for example the new GeForce 1070 (or even 1080 if they can afford it). Lower-end graphics cards and previous generations should also run quite nicely, such as the for example 1060, 970, 960, etc, but the newer and higher end, the better.

They also need two physical screens, or a dedicated video grabber hardware as the second output. The resolution of the output screen should be the same as you do live streaming on, typically 1920x1080.
