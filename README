DBschema.sql		Database schema used in this application

libfap.py		APRS parser routine

parserfuncs.py		The set of routines to extract the main data from the APRS packets

kglid.py		The list of known gliders, this list isvgenerated weekly from the OGN device data base 

settings.py		The settings used by this application. You need to define here if your are using MySQL or not and the name of the user/password and host

Currently the system is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a HDD SDD of 128 Gb., using Raspbian Jessie distro. The MySQL version uses a Oracle's MySQL database hosted on a WDC Mirror nas/nfs server. 

For any bug please report it thru the GitHub account, open an issue and I will try to solve it.
